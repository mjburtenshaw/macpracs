Headers
--------------

Everything you wanted to know about headers--and maybe some things you didn't want to know.

### Casing

All headers should use Title Case.

> Title case is a capitalization style in which the first letter of each major word in a sentence or phrase is capitalized, while the rest of the letters are in lowercase. Major words usually include nouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, and pronouns. Articles (like "the", "a", "an"), conjunctions (like "and", "but", "or"), and prepositions (like "in", "on", "with") are often not capitalized unless they are the first or last word of the title.
>
> For example, the sentence "senior software engineer skilled in react and node" would be converted to title case as "Senior Software Engineer Skilled in React and Node."
>
> Title case is commonly used in various contexts, including writing titles of articles, books, movie titles, headings, and more. It helps to give titles a polished and organized appearance, making them easier to read and understand.
>
> Understanding title case can be valuable as you work on documentation, presentations, and other forms of written communication.

Nouns
----------

Treat the proper nouns of vendors the same way they do, e.g., ClickUp capitalizes their Tasks.
