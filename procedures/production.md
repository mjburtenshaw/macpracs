1. Address physiological imbalances:

3. Restrict incoming communication:
	- Equip headphones.
	- Play music.
	- When workspace policy permits, set your status to do not disturb on communication platforms.
	- When workspace policy permits, set focus to do not disturb.
4. Get into context:
	- Start a task timer.
	- Update task metadata.
	- [Analyze the task](/procedures/developer-analysis.md) to verify it's ready for work.
5. Apply a solution that achieves the desired outcomes. Many solutions require [development](/procedures/development.md), but some might not.
6. [Debrief](#debrief) the task at the end of the context session.

#### Debrief

1. Report progress.
2. Stop the task timer.
