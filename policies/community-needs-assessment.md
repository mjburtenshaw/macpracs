# Community Needs Assessment

> *"A team is not a group of people who work together. A team is a group of people who trust each other."*

As a development leader, my commitment to the team is twofold: I advocate for team members and uphold standards for information and technology protection.

Understanding each team member‚Äôs needs is crucial to addressing attrition risk and building a supportive, transparent culture.

## Advocating for Team Members

Effective advocacy relies on understanding the factors impacting team members and proactively addressing them. To do this, I tailor my approach by understanding each team member‚Äôs preferred communication style and focusing on these core questions:

- Are you safe?
- Are you ready?
- Are you valued?

These conversations are documented and shared between the team member and myself to ensure a shared understanding of the current state.

### Are You Safe?

To determine if a team member feels safe, I assess the organization‚Äôs support and identify any gaps. While privacy is respected, trust is built through open dialogue around needs and company alignment.

Using [the employee hierarchy of needs](/policies/the-employee-hierarchy-of-needs.md), I cover various dimensions of safety:

Questions should be phrased in a way that focuses on the company's shortcomings rather than the employee's.

- Does the company‚Äôs compensation package (cash, benefits, equity) support your economic needs? If not, what adjustments would make a difference?
- The company‚Äôs values are X, Y, and Z. Do you feel they are reflected in our daily operations? Where do you see room for alignment?
- Are we leveraging your unique skills? If not, what areas would you like to focus on?
- Do you have sufficient opportunities to develop new skills? What type of growth opportunities are you looking for?
- Given compensation, culture, and growth opportunities, do you envision being here long-term?

Additionally, I remind team members that I am vigilant about addressing any form of abuse within the system:

- If instances of abuse arise, I will take steps to address or report them through proper channels.
- Options for anonymous reporting will be reiterated at the start of each quarter.

### Are You Ready?

This section examines any internal factors that may be impeding a team member‚Äôs productivity and effectiveness. Questions include:

- Do you feel communication on the team is effective? Are you receiving timely responses?
- Are there any policies or procedures you find counterproductive? Any ideas for improvement?
- Is there a particular platform or tool that creates friction in your work?
- Would you describe our structure as sufficient or lacking?
- Do you have any feedback on our documentation practices or culture?

### Are You Valued?

Recognition plays a critical role in supporting team retention. I encourage each team member to define the form of validation that is most meaningful to them‚Äîwhether it‚Äôs public acknowledgment, awards, monetary incentives, or symbolic gestures like being named a domain expert.

My goal is to ensure that each team member feels recognized in a way that resonates with them.

## Protecting Information and Technology

My approach to safeguarding information and technology involves:

- Maintaining accurate, up-to-date documentation on workflows.
- Ensuring the team‚Äôs workflows are executed as prescribed.
- Addressing any deviations by integrating them into the workflow documentation.
- Withholding approval on tasks that could compromise best practices.
- Classifying and documenting any exceptions to best practices, collaborating with the Staff team to address these as needed.
