Advocating for Team Members
----------------------------

I will learn the best ways to communicate with each team member effectively.

### Are You Safe?

I will look out for abuse of team members made by people or processes in our system.
- If abuse is detected, I will tactfully affect change where I can or otherwise report abuse via proper channels.
- I will remind team members of this and other options to anonymously report abuse at the beginning of each quarter.

### Are You Ready?

I will set up the team members for success:
- I will schedule meetings only when necessary to keep everyone on a reasonable schedule because of time zone differences.
- When necessary, I will work with team members to schedule meetings at the most reasonable time possible.
- I will act promptly to discover and deliver the resources team members need to do their job effectively.
- I will make best practices accessible and keep them current.

### Are You Valued?

I will foster an environment where team members feel valued:
- I will communicate negatively connoted content in a private and constructive manner.
- I will celebrate the victories of the team and its members with its individuals, the team proper, and the wider team according to their privacy preferences.
	- I will learn the privacy preferences of each team member.
- I will present suggestions to improve processes made by team members.
- If I have the power to change the processes in question, I will be flexible to implement those changes.
- I will do what I can to place people in roles where they feel they provide the best value.

Protecting Information and Technology
-------------------------------------

- I will document the team‚Äôs workflows and keep them current.
- I will execute the team‚Äôs workflows as prescribed.
- I will account for deviations as part of the workflow when deviations arise.
- I will not approve tasks that break best practices.
- When best practices exceptions arise:
	- I will classify and document the exception.
	- I will work with the Staff team to update our best practices to address the exception.
