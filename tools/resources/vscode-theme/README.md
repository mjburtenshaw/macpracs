# Themodynamic Stark

> *"The system does not seek peace. It seeks containment."*

A VS Code theme based on the Themodynamic Stark color palette from the Kuroki fantasy universe. This theme embodies a zero-sum narrative economy rendered in color—pops of meaningful color against an otherwise desaturated world.

## Design Philosophy

**Aesthetic Origin**: Color is rare. When it appears, it means something.

The palette is organized according to the Eldritch Keys cosmology:

- **Void Band** (3 colors): Forgetting, absence, silence
- **Key Band** (3 colors): Preservation, clarity, witness
- **Memory Band** (24 colors): What we preserve

## Variants

### Themodynamic Dark
- Background: Void 0 (`#131114`) - deepest shadow
- Foreground: Key 1 (`#edebe4`) - standard paper base
- Accent: Memory.Grace 1 (`#a3457a`) - Tyrian purple

### Themodynamic Light
- Background: Key 1 (`#edebe4`) - standard paper base
- Foreground: Void 1 (`#201d21`) - standard dark
- Accent: Memory.Grace 2 (`#7a2656`) - deep Tyrian
