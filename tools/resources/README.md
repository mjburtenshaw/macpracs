Items
------

- Color palettes; because having pretty colors is nice, but very tedious to make from scratch.
- Terminal profiles; terminal profiles are also a pain to set up.
- Recovery resources:
    - Bullet Train source code.
- Fonts:
    - Fira Code.
- Scripts:
    - [`recover.sh`](/tools/resources/recover.sh): See [Recovery](#recovery).
    - [`add-ssh-key.sh`](/tools/resources/add-ssh-key.sh). This was a useful artifact of the first iteration of the recover script.

Recovery
---------

Not everything works out of the box!

This is what I would do if I had to get up an running on a new machine as quickly as possible:
1. Install [Logi Options+](https://www.logitech.com/en-us/software/logi-options-plus.html).
2. [Install Rectangle Pro](https://rectangleapp.com).
3. Add [Fira Code](/tools/resources/Fira_Code.zip) to Font Book.
4. Install Go.
5. [Install Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/tutorials/gcp-get-started/install-cli).
6. Install [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md).
7. Run [`recover.sh`](/tools/resources/recover.sh).
8. Open this repo in Obsidian.
9. Install programs listed in [Software and Services](/tools/README.md#software-and-services).
