# Themodynamic Stark - Font Philosophy

> *"The system does not seek peace. It seeks containment."*

## The Attack on Titan Aesthetic

The visual inspiration from **Attack on Titan** suggests:

- **Brutal functionality** over decoration
- **Military/utilitarian** aesthetic - field reports, not literature
- **Stark, industrial** world with rare moments of beauty
- **Germanic/technical** influences (die Mauer, Survey Corps logs)
- **Archival precision** - witness and document, don't embellish
- **High contrast** between mundane utility and meaningful moments

## Themodynamic Stark Principle

> *"Color is rare. When it appears, it means something."*

Applied to typography:
- **Most text is functional** - the desaturated base
- **Distinction is earned** - like pops of color in the palette
- **Not about prettiness** - about containment and witness
- **Archival, not literary** - Colt's Oswikaric field reports, not poetry

## Font Characteristics

### What We DON'T Want

❌ **Warm, humanist fonts** (too friendly)
❌ **Decorative serifs** (too literary, too pretty)
❌ **Trendy, modern** (too temporary)
❌ **Calligraphic** (too personal)

These violate the "stark functionality" principle.

### What We DO Want

✅ **Technical/industrial** - typewriter, telegraph, field reports
✅ **Military precision** - clear, authoritative, no-nonsense
✅ **Archival quality** - designed to last, to witness
✅ **Germanic/systematic** - DIN standards, engineering precision
✅ **Monospace aesthetic** - mechanical, not organic
✅ **Slab serifs** (if serif) - industrial, not literary

## Font Philosophy Options

### Option 1: The Field Report (Pure Utilitarian)

**All contexts use variants of the SAME typeface family.**

Like a military organization that standardizes on ONE font for all official documents.

**IBM Plex Family:**
- **Prose:** IBM Plex Serif (technical serif, not warm)
- **Notes:** IBM Plex Sans (systematic, industrial)
- **Code:** IBM Plex Mono (obvious choice)

**Rationale:**
- Created by IBM for technical documentation
- Systematic, not humanist
- Germanic precision meets industrial design
- All three variants designed together
- Free and open source
- "Big Blue" institutional authority

**Vibe:** "Official Survey Corps documentation system"

---

### Option 2: The Typewriter (Maximum Brutality)

**Everything is monospace.** The ultimate field report aesthetic.

**Courier Variants:**
- **Prose:** Courier Prime (refined version of Courier)
- **Notes:** Courier Prime (same)
- **Code:** Courier Prime Code (optimized for programming)

**Rationale:**
- Actual typewriter font - field reports, telegraph messages
- Zero pretension - pure functionality
- Monospace everywhere = maximum uniformity
- Like military logs typed on portable typewriters
- The font that documented wars and expeditions

**Vibe:** "Survey Corps field reports typed in the field"

---

### Option 3: The German Standard (Industrial Precision)

**DIN-inspired systematic fonts.**

**The System:**
- **Prose:** Roboto Slab (geometric slab serif, industrial)
- **Notes:** DIN Next or Roboto (German road sign aesthetic)
- **Code:** Roboto Mono (mechanical precision)

**Rationale:**
- DIN = Deutsche Industrie Norm (German Industrial Standard)
- Used on road signs, technical documents
- Geometric, not humanist
- Maximum legibility with zero warmth
- The font of engineering blueprints

**Vibe:** "German military technical documentation"

---

### Option 4: The Archive (Stark Contrast)

**Monospace base with slab serif for rare distinction.**

Like the Themodynamic palette: desaturated base, pops of meaningful color.

**The System:**
- **Prose:** Zilla Slab (Mozilla's utilitarian slab serif) - **the rare distinction**
- **Notes:** Anonymous Pro (monospace sans) - **the functional base**
- **Code:** Anonymous Pro (same) - **pure utility**

**Rationale:**
- Most text is monospace (desaturated)
- Prose files get slab serif distinction (pop of color)
- Anonymous Pro: designed for coders who read a lot
- Zilla Slab: utilitarian, not decorative
- High contrast between modes = meaningful difference

**Vibe:** "Field reports (mono) vs. formal chronicles (slab)"

---

## Recommended: Option 1 (IBM Plex Family)

### Why IBM Plex Aligns Best

1. **Systematic Unity**
   - One family, three variants
   - Like a standardized military documentation system
   - Visual consistency with contextual distinction

2. **Technical Authority**
   - Created for IBM's rebranding
   - Designed for technical content
   - Industrial, not literary

3. **Germanic Precision**
   - Influenced by Helvetica and Akzidenz-Grotesk
   - Systematic, not humanist
   - Engineering precision

4. **Archival Quality**
   - Designed for longevity
   - Clear at all sizes
   - Professional, institutional

5. **Attack on Titan Aesthetic**
   - Could imagine Survey Corps using this
   - Technical reports, not novels
   - Functional, not decorative
   - Military precision

### The IBM Plex System

**IBM Plex Serif** (Prose):
- Technical serif, not warm/literary
- Slab-like qualities without being fully slab
- Designed for body text in technical documentation
- Has authority without pretension

**IBM Plex Sans** (Notes):
- Systematic, geometric
- Industrial without being cold
- Excellent for scanning and hierarchies
- The workhorse font

**IBM Plex Mono** (Code):
- Designed for programming
- Clear, unambiguous characters
- Good ligature support
- Technical precision

---

## Character Alignment

- **IBM Plex Serif** → Colt's formal Oswikaric field documentation
- **IBM Plex Sans** → Alice's systematic worldbuilding logs
- **IBM Plex Mono** → Technical specifications, code, structure

Not "Colt writes literature" but "Colt documents the world with precision."

---

## Why NOT Charter/Inter (Previous Recommendation)

**Charter:**
- ❌ Too warm and literary
- ❌ Designed for books, not field reports
- ❌ Old-style serif = humanist, not industrial
- ❌ Doesn't match AoT aesthetic

**Inter:**
- ✅ Actually fine - modern, clean
- ⚠️ But maybe too friendly/contemporary
- ⚠️ UI font, not archival font

**The real issue:** They don't convey "military field documentation."

---

## Alternative Considerations

### If IBM Plex Feels Too Corporate

**Roboto Family:**
- More neutral/utilitarian
- Less "IBM institutional"
- Still systematic and industrial
- Roboto Slab, Roboto, Roboto Mono

### If You Want Maximum Brutality

**Go full Courier:**
- Pure typewriter aesthetic
- Maximum field report vibe
- Zero pretension
- Courier Prime for everything

### If You Want German Precision

**DIN Next + Roboto Mono:**
- Actual German industrial standard
- Road signs and technical manuals
- Combined with Roboto Mono for code

---

## Font Sizes (Adjusted for IBM Plex)

```css
/* Tighter than Charter - more technical */
--font-size-prose: 17px;   /* Slightly smaller than literary fonts */
--font-size-notes: 16px;   /* Standard */
--font-size-code: 14px;    /* Code stays compact */

--line-height-prose: 1.7;  /* Less generous than literary */
--line-height-notes: 1.6;  /* Functional */
--line-height-code: 1.5;   /* Technical */
```

---

## Installation

### IBM Plex (Free and Open Source)

**Download:**
- [GitHub: IBM/plex](https://github.com/IBM/plex)
- Or: Google Fonts has IBM Plex

**Install all three:**
1. IBM Plex Serif
2. IBM Plex Sans
3. IBM Plex Mono

**Restart Obsidian**

---

## Visual Comparison

### Literary Approach (Charter/Inter)
```
Charter Serif → Book pages, literature
Inter Sans → Modern UI, friendly
Feels: Warm, inviting, literary
```

### Themodynamic Approach (IBM Plex)
```
IBM Plex Serif → Technical manuals, reports
IBM Plex Sans → Industrial documentation
Feels: Precise, systematic, archival
```

### Maximum Brutality (Courier)
```
Courier everywhere → Typewriter reports
Feels: Field logs, military, stark
```

## The Verdict

For **Themodynamic Stark** aesthetic inspired by **Attack on Titan**:

🥇 **IBM Plex Family** - Best balance of systematic precision and readability
🥈 **Roboto Family** - More neutral, still industrial
🥉 **Courier Prime** - Maximum field report aesthetic (but potentially fatiguing)

---

## Next Steps

1. **Install IBM Plex** (all three variants)
2. **Update `contextual-fonts.css`** with new font stack
3. **Test with prose and notes files**
4. **Adjust sizes if needed** (start with 17px prose, 16px notes)

The fonts should feel like **military documentation**, not **creative literature**.

*"The system does not seek peace. It seeks containment."*

Typography is part of the containment system.
