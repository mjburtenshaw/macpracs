## Side-by-Side Comparison

### IBM Plex Family (Recommended)

```
Prose:  IBM Plex Serif (technical serif)
Notes:  IBM Plex Sans (industrial sans)

Feels Like: Survey Corps official reports
```

**Pros:**

- ✅ Germanic precision
- ✅ Still very readable
- ✅ Free and open source

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Need to install all three fonts

### Courier (Maximum Brutality)

```
Prose:  Courier Prime (typewriter)
Notes:  Courier Prime (same)
Code:   Courier Prime Code (typewriter for code)

Aesthetic: Typewriter field reports
Feels Like: Handwritten logs from the field
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Pure typewriter aesthetic
- ✅ Maximum functional brutality
- ✅ Courier New is built-in
- ✅ Most "Attack on Titan" vibe
- ✅ Character-based alignment

**Cons:**
- ⚠️ Can be fatiguing for long sessions

### Charter + Inter (Readable Literary)

```
Prose:  Charter (classic serif)
Notes:  Inter (modern sans)
Code:   FiraCode (ligatures)

Aesthetic: Traditional book + modern UI
Feels Like: Literature and documentation
```

**Pros:**
- ✅ Charter built into macOS

## Use Case Recommendations

### For Creative Writing Projects (Kuroki vault)

**Recommended:** **IBM Plex**

**Why:**
- Prose writing benefits from serif (Plex Serif)
- Worldbuilding notes benefit from systematic sans (Plex Sans)
- Still maintains the stark, archival aesthetic
- Won't fatigue you during 3-hour writing sessions
- Feels like "official documentation" not "literature"

### For Maximum Aesthetic Purity

**Recommended:** **Courier**

**Why:**
- Pure commitment to the field report aesthetic
- Everything is typewriter = everything is documentation
- Most aligned with AoT "Survey Corps logs" vibe
- Character alignment system works perfectly in monospace
- "Color is rare" = distinction is earned, not given through font choice

### For General Use / Readability First

**Recommended:** **Charter/Inter**

**Why:**
- Most readable for extended sessions
- Professional appearance
- Built-in fonts (Charter)
- Good for mixed content
- **But:** Doesn't align with Themodynamic philosophy

---

## Character Alignment

### IBM Plex System

- **IBM Plex Serif** → Colt's formal Oswikaric documentation
- **IBM Plex Sans** → Alice's systematic worldbuilding
- **IBM Plex Mono** → Technical specifications

**Voice:** "Official Survey Corps documentation protocols"

### Courier System

- **Courier Prime** → All field reports, all contexts
- **No distinction by font** = distinction by content alone

**Voice:** "Everything is a field log typed under harsh conditions"

### Charter/Inter System

- **Charter** → Traditional literature
- **Inter** → Modern notes
- **FiraCode** → Code

**Voice:** "Writer's traditional toolkit" (not aligned with theme)

## Sample Text

### IBM Plex Serif (17px, 1.7 line height)
```
The wall stood forty meters high. Colt documented the Survey
Corps movements with systematic precision. Each entry was
logged according to Oswikaric field protocols. The system did
not seek peace. It sought containment.
```

### Courier Prime (16px, 1.8 line height)
```
The wall stood forty meters high. Colt documented the
Survey Corps movements with systematic precision. Each
entry was logged according to Oswikaric field protocols.
The system did not seek peace. It sought containment.
```

### Charter (18px, 1.8 line height)
```
The wall stood forty meters high. Colt documented the Survey Corps
movements with systematic precision. Each entry was logged according
to Oswikaric field protocols. The system did not seek peace. It sought
containment.
```
