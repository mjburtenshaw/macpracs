### Design Decisions

#### Color Philosophy
"Color is rare. When it appears, it means something." - Each color in the palette is tied to a specific character from the Hollowgraft narrative:
- **Memory.Whispers** (red): Alice's favorite color
- **Memory.Wrath** (orange): Colt's eye striations
- **Memory.Sage** (green): Alice's eyes
- **Memory.Silver** (blue): Silver's eyes
- **Memory.Garden** (yellow): Mary Feybrook's hair
- **Memory.Grace** (purple): Colt's scarf

#### Typography
- System fonts for interface consistency
- Monospace font support with FiraCode recommendation
- Optimized line heights for readability

#### Accessibility
- WCAG AAA compliant contrast ratios
- Clear focus indicators
- Distinct interactive states
- Readable text sizes

### Technical Details
- Minimum Obsidian version: 0.16.0
- No dependencies or build process
- Pure CSS implementation
- CSS custom properties for easy customization
- Support for both light and dark base themes

### Known Issues
None at initial release.

### Credits
- Theme designed by Malcolm Burtenshaw
- Based on the Themodynamic Stark palette from the Kuroki universe
- Inspired by the Hollowgraft narrative series
