Philosophy
----------------

> Το σύνολο είναι περισσότερο από το άθροισμα των μερών του
>
> *"The whole is more than the sum of its parts."*
> *- Aristotle*

My philosophy takes the following assumptions as given:
1. People have rights.
2. Diverse power groups provide a net benefit.
3. Describing a system provides a net benefit.
4. Systems can be iterated empirically.

People
----------

> *"The four characteristics of humanism are curiosity, a free mind, belief in good taste, and belief in the human race."*
> 
> *- E.M. Forster*

I have [a credo of sorts for assessing community needs](community-needs-assessment.md).

More to come.

Policies

Procedures
----------------

In general, this is what my work days usually look like:
1. [Startup](administration.md#startup).
2. [Reading](#reading).
3. [Peer review](peer-review.md).
4. [Production](#production).
7. [Study](#study).
8. [Shutdown](administration.md#shutdown).

With some meetings and breaks littered in, of course.

### Administration

How I get ready for production and leisure.

> 🏛️ *See [administration](administration.md) if you wanna know how I keep the lights on.*

### Reading

> *"The man who does not read has no advantage over the man who cannot read."*
> 
> *- Mark Twain*

Here's my daily news intake:
1. [Apple News Today](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/apple-news-today/id1473872585) for the biggest Global and US news.
2. I get a digest in my email inbox from [TLDR Web Dev](https://tldr.tech/webdev).
3. I'm subscribed to [Google Workspace Updates](https://workspaceupdates.googleblog.com).

### Peer Review

I use [macglab](https://github.com/mjburtenshaw/macglab) to quickly index open GitLab Merge Requests I care to review.

How I perform peer reviews (PRs).

> 📚 *See [peer-review](peer-review.md) if you wanna know what it takes to get my approval.*

### Production

> *"**Deep Work:** Professional activities performed in a state of distraction-free concentration that push your cognitive capabilities to their limit. These efforts create new value, improve your skill,  and are hard to replicate."*
> 
> *- Cal Newport*

1. Address physiological imbalances:
	- Use the restroom.
	- Have a snack.
	- Prepare a *small* glass of water. Use its emptiness to cue screen breaks.
2. Restrict incoming communication:
	- Equip headphones.
	- Play music.
	- Set my status to do not disturb on communication platforms.
	- Set focus to do not disturb.
3. Get into context:
	- Start a task timer.
	- Update task metadata.
	- [Analyze the task](developer-analysis.md) to verify it's ready for work.
4. Apply a solution that achieves the desired outcomes. Many solutions require [development](development.md), but some might not.
5. [Debrief](#debrief) the task at the end of the context session.

#### Debrief

1. Report progress.
2. Stop the task timer.
3. Update task metadata.

### Study

> *"The purpose of education is to replace an empty mind with an open one."*
> 
> *- Malcolm Forbes*

Right now, I'm studying [Go](https://go.dev).
