## Philosophy

> Το σύνολο είναι περισσότερο από το άθροισμα των μερών του
>
> _"The whole is more than the sum of its parts."_ - Aristotle

See [Code is Maintained by AI](philosophies/code-is-maintained-by-ai.md) for my core engineering philosophy.

**TL;DR:** I optimize for operational excellence through:
- **AI-maintainable code** - Explicit over clever, context over brevity
- **Incentive alignment** - Make the right thing the easy thing
- **Toil reduction** - For me, my team, the business

My approach: Build systems that don't require heroics. Align incentives so doing the right thing is easier than cutting corners. Let AI handle undifferentiated maintenance labor.

If you want someone who works sustainably, delivers reliable systems, and thinks in incentives rather than ideals, let's talk.

## People

> _"The four characteristics of humanism are curiosity, a free mind, belief in good taste, and belief in the human race."_

More to come.

## Policies

- [How to write documents](/policies/doc-style-guide.md).
- [How to care for developer communities](/policies/community-needs-assessment.md)

## Procedures

In general, this is what my work days usually look like:

1. [Startup](/procedures/startup.md).
2. [Reading](/procedures/reading.md).
3. [Peer review](/procedures/peer-review.md).
4. [Production](/procedures/production.md).
5. [Study](/procedures/study.md).
6. [Shutdown](/procedures/shutdown.md).

With some meetings and breaks littered in, of course.

If I'm trying to configure my home network, I should refer to [Home System Administration](procedures/home-sysadmin.md)
