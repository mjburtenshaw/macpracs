Philosophy

> Το σύνολο είναι περισσότερο από το άθροισμα των μερών του

> *"The whole is more than the sum of its parts."*
> *- Aristotle*

My philosophy takes the following assumptions as given:
1. People have rights.
2. Diverse power groups provide a net benefit.
3. Describing a system provides a net benefit.
4. Systems can be iterated empirically.

2. [Reading](#reading).
3. [Peer review](peer-review.md).

With some meetings and breaks littered in, of course.
