Philosophy
-----------

> Το σύνολο είναι περισσότερο από το άθροισμα των μερών του
>
> *"The whole is more than the sum of its parts."*
> *- Aristotle*

My philosophy takes the following assumptions as given:
1. People have rights.
2. Diverse power groups provide a net benefit.
3. Describing a system provides a net benefit.
4. Systems can be iterated empirically.

> *"The four characteristics of humanism are curiosity, a free mind, belief in good taste, and belief in the human race."*
