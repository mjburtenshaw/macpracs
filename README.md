> *"The whole is more than the sum of its parts."*
> *- Aristotle*

This philosophy takes the following assumptions as given:
1. People have rights.
2. Diverse power groups provide a net benefit.
3. Describing a system provides a net benefit.
4. Systems can be iterated empirically.

### Systems

A system has intrinsic attributes and always exists whether or not its participants know it. But knowledge is power, and you can change a system if you know how it works. You can identify system components by asking these questions:
1. Who does the system involve?
2. What are the desired outcomes?
3. Where and when do events occur?
4. Why are some outcomes desired over others?
5. How do people achieve the outcomes?

#### People and Ethics

> *"Remember that people break down, too, not just machinery."*
> 
> *- Gregory Benford*

People are the most critical component of any system because people have rights. Ultimately, nothing happens without them.

It's people who decide what means justify which ends.

There are two types of people in every system: those who have power and those who don't. It's important for those with power to consider the effect their decisions have on those who don't. It's essential to have a diversity of people in a system to round out the considerations of actors.

#### Policies

> Politik ist die Kunst des M√∂glichen, des Erreichbaren ‚Äì die Kunst des N√§chstbesten
> 
> *"Politics is the art of the possible, the attainable ‚Äî the art of the next best"*
> *- Otto von Bismarck*

Policy answers the question: What are we trying to achieve?

These are the ends. The system evolves or dies on its fulfillment. On death, it is always replaced by another system.

> üßê Based on the nascent [philosophy](#philosophy-1), this can either be a good thing... or a very bad thing.

When adhered to, policies change human behavior in ways expected and not. It's impossible to know what you don't know, so it's essential to monitor the impact of policies to see if the unintended consequences can be lived with.

#### Procedures

> *- Alexander Ostrovsky*

If policies are the ends, then procedures are the means.

There's no just-right level of detail for a process. Procedures come in all sorts of details, from very granular instruction manuals at enterprise corporations to, "Just ask Bill." Figuring out what works best depends on the complexity of other system components.

It's fascinating that procedures enshrine policy in the absence of their expression.

When policy is expressed, it's important to ensure that procedures can empirically fulfill the policies they're attached to. If you can't reconcile the two, it's time to axe the procedure or update the policy.
