## Philosophy

> Το σύνολο είναι περισσότερο από το άθροισμα των μερών του
>
> _"The whole is more than the sum of its parts."_ > _- Aristotle_

My philosophy takes the following assumptions as given:

1. People have rights.
2. Diverse power groups provide a net benefit.
3. Describing a system provides a net benefit.
4. Systems can be iterated empirically.

## People

> _"The four characteristics of humanism are curiosity, a free mind, belief in good taste, and belief in the human race."_
>
> _- E.M. Forster_

More to come.

## Policies

- [How to write documents](/policies/doc-style-guide.md).
- [How to care for developer communities](/policies/community-needs-assessment.md)

## Procedures

In general, this is what my work days usually look like:

1. [Startup](/procedures/startup.md).
2. [Reading](/procedures/reading.md).
3. [Peer review](/procedures/peer-review.md).
4. [Production](/procedures/production.md).
5. [Study](/procedures/study.md).
6. [Shutdown](/procedures/shutdown.md).

With some meetings and breaks littered in, of course.

If I'm trying to configure my home network, I should refer to [Home System Administration](procedures/home-sysadmin.md)
