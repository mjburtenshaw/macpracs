Procedure
----------------

🧐 Read the Task description and answer the following questions:

- Is the Task priority defined?
- Is the Task due date realistic?
- Is the Task sized?
- Does the Task describe the problem, how to resolve it, and validate the results?
- Do I *understand* what the problem is?
- Do I understand and *agree* with the proposed solution?
- Do I understand how to validate outcomes and the *impact* of the proposed changes?

👎🏻 Do the following if the answer to any of these questions is no:

1. Report your analysis as a comment on the Task.
2. See if a peer is available to clarify the Task details.

> 🫱🏻‍🫲🏿 If so, work together to resolve concerns. If the task requires a status regression, [exit the task context]().

> 🛑 If not, set the task status to blocked and [exit the task context]().
